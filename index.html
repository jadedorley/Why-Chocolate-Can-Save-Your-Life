            <h2> Jade has been working with chocolate for years. Her love for chocolate was a love like no other (and it was <em>definitely</em> a better love story than Twilight). In 2010 she became a chocolatier with her own brand: Jadey's Chocolate. Jadey's chocolate became so big that they bought Hershey's and Reese's. </h2>

            <h2><strong><marquee> Reasons to Eat Chocolate</marquee></strong></h2>
            <p> Chocolate has been scientifically proven to improve your mental and physical health. It is not only tasty but healthy as well. Here are a few reasons why:</p>
            <ol>
               <li>Chocolate is good for your blood and heart circulation</li>
               <li> Chocolate restores flexibility in your arteries and prevents your arteries from getting clogged which would contribute to heart attacks</li> 
               <li>  Dark chocolate is packed with vitamins such as potassium,zinc and selenium. Also a 100 gram bar of dark chocolate provides 67% iron</li>
               <li>Chocolate is good for mothers and infants. Mothers who eat chocolate are less stressed and babies whose mothers eat chocolate smile more often</li>
               <li>Dark chocolate has been found to prevent brain injuries and it helps to eat it when studying because chocolate can help with memory retention</li>
               <li>PEA or phenethylamine is a chemical found in chocolate in small quantities that stimulates the nervous system and triggers the release of pleasurable opium-like compounds known as endorphins. Chocolate also contains a chemical called: tryptophan which helps to create serotonin which makes you happy</li>
               <li>Chocolate can actually lower blood pressure</li>
            </ol>

           <p><strong><u>Jade's Chocolate Statement</u></strong></p>
           <p>It takes time to make chocolate, you can‚Äôt mass produce chocolate like it‚Äôs nothing, like it‚Äôs cereal or something. Nobody takes time to make cereal. But with chocolate they have to pick the coco seeds,process them slowly, then send it to chocolatiers so they can do their jobs with the melting chocolate and the mixing and the tasting, until the chocolate is just right. That‚Äôs chocolate. That kind of chocolate is the good stuff, the kind that warms you up on a beautiful fall day,whether it be in the form of hot chocolate or a chocolate bar. The kind that you‚Äôd want to share with the world and yet never let anyone come near your stash. The kind that brings you back to when you were a baby screaming for chocolate in the womb...or maybe that was just me. The point is there are so many memories to be had with chocolate. Like when you made chocolates for your crush and when he ate it his smile illuminated the room. Or when you and your mom shared a box of chocolate and really bonded that night. Or maybe it‚Äôs as simple as you remembering how exceptional your chocolate tasted that one time so you remembered it when you were 30. You can‚Äôt deny the amazing sensation felt when a piece of chocolate hits your tongue‚Ä¶ You literally can‚Äôt, because it‚Äôs scientifically proven that chocolate releases endorphins and serotonin to make you feel good. Hence why eating a piece of chocolate during a stressful day can make your day a little less stressful and a bit more joyful.</p>
